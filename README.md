### About this project
This project was started from a [Vue Template](https://github.com/jdhillen/vue-template) project

Please take a look at the original repo to see that I did not use any previously developed app.

### Details
Things I found interesting about this project
- Not all the movies had all the proper information. Good trick.
- Images were not all the same size.
- The tagging of genres wasn't how I would have implemented them and was difficult to implement

Overall I wish I could say that I was happy with my project, but ultimately I was unable to complete
all the minimum requirements in the 4 hour time limit. Given more time I would like to finish up wiring
the genres search, as it is partially hooked up. I would also like to spend more time on the UI. I really
enjoy doing front end / css work so the fact that it's pretty blah is also disheartening. Trying to work
as fast as I could, I ended up repeating myself a few times. Things could be more paired down and concise.
